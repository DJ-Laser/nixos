n16 is my rice for NixOS, named as such because it uses the [**N**iri window manager](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) and [base**16** themes](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) with the help of [stylix](https://stylix.danth.me/)

## Try it out!
You can easily install this onto any nixos system! just clone the repo and run `nixox-rebuild-switch --flake .#nix-desktop`
This will install my config to your system, but you can always revert back to your config later (it is nixos after all)
